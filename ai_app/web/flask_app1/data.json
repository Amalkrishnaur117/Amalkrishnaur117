        "It uses less bandwidth, making it suitable for IoT devices.",

        "MQTT is reliable, even with weak internet connections."
      ],
      "script": "MQTT is popular in IoT because it uses minimal bandwidth, allowing devices to send and receive data quickly. This makes it possible for devices to work smoothly even with limited internet. MQTT is also reliable, so your devices stay connected."

      "points": [
        "MQTT uses a publish and subscribe model.",
        "Devices send messages (publish) to a server called a broker.",
        "Other devices can receive these messages if they subscribe to them."
      ],
      "script": "In MQTT, devices communicate by publishing messages to a broker. The broker then sends these messages to other devices that subscribe to the messages. This allows many devices to connect and share information easily."

        "To use MQTT, you need a broker like Mosquitto.",

        "You can experiment with MQTT on a computer or with simple IoT devices."
      ],
      "script": "To start using MQTT, you need a broker, which is like a central server that all devices connect to. Popular brokers include Mosquitto, which you can install on your computer or a server. Once connected, devices can publish and subscribe to messages to share data easily."
