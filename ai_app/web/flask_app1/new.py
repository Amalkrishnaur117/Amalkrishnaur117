    points: A list of 2-4 essential points related to the topic.

    If a specific language is given, translate the script to that language; otherwise, default to English.

        Beginner: Use simple language and provide clear explanations, assuming no prior knowledge.
        Medium: Include moderate detail, assuming basic familiarity with the topic.
